## UDP Wrapper for Windows and Linux operating systems.
### Either include udpx_udp_windows.c or udpx_udp_linux.c based on which OS you will be using.
## The function names do exactly what you expect them to do.
### I didn't test the linux code so if there is anything needed to be fixed, let me know.
